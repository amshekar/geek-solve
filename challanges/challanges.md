1	Given the array, find the longest sub-array in that array for which the sum of the values is equal to zero. e.g. in the array of [-4, -20, 2, 2, 8, 3, -5, 10, -300, 6, 8] the sub-array will be [-20, 2, 2, 8, 3, -5, 10]. Notice that you cannot chance the order of the values in the original arrays.

2	Given the array, find a sub-array in that array for which the sum of the values is the maximum. e.g. in the array of [4, -20, 4, 3, 2, -5, 10, -300] the sub-array will be [4, 3, 2, -5, 10]. Notice that you cannot chance the order of the values in the original arrays.

3	Given an array of integers and a window size, output the maximum value of the sliding window as the window moves over the entire array. Example: Input: [ 1,2,3,5,-5,4,6,7,3,-10,-3,8,1], Window Size = 5

4	Write a program that will shuffle through the song names from the library and print them in random order. Each song shall be returned only once. Ideas to consider: Do you want to (a) randomize the values of the array in a new array and print them out or do you want to (b) randomly pick values from the original array, check if they did not repeat and print them out one after another?

5	Write a function generateRandomNumbers to generate all the integer values from 1...n  exactly once, where n is the input.

6	Count the number of unique channel/slot combinations that have status code > 200. 

  Log format: \<timestamp>,\<channel-num>,\<slot-num>,\<status-code>,\<description>\; #
 
 Example input:
 
•	12:00 1 1 200 Success
 
•	12:00 1 2 500 Error
 
•	12:00 1 3 200 Success
 
•	12:00 1 2 200 Success
 
•	12:00 1 5 200 Success
 
•	12:01 2 1 500 Error
 
•	12:01 1 2 500 Error
 
•	12:01 1 5 500 Error
 
•	Expected Output (<channel-num> <slot-num>):
 
•	1 2, 1 5 , 2 1
  
# set 2:
7	Find and replace a substring within a given string. Something like this: https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string-replace
  
8	You have an array of numbers of random order. Print out the numbers in an ascending order. Or print out the numbers but remove duplicates.
  
9	You have an array of strings. Find and print all palindrome word from the array (palindrome are the words that read the same backward and forward (e.g. anna, hanah, level, etc.)
  
10 	Write a code in your preferred programming language to read the input string and define if it is a palindrome word or not (a palindrome word is that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam, rotor, etc.)
  
11	Search a substring in a string and return its index for the first occurrence.
  
12	Input: array of [1, 3, 11, 11, 1, 9, 3], Write a function that returns the element that appears only once.
 
 
 Get ready to answer why your solution is optimal or how you can optimize it further. Discuss the algorithm complexity - n, log(n), n2, etc.
